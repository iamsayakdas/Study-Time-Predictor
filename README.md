# Study-Time-Predictor
Faculty want to estimate how much time each student studies daily for better mentoring.

The objective of this project is to develop a regression model to predict student study time.
This prediction is based on survey data, using the number of books read in the past year as a
proxy for study hours. The primary goal is to identify students who may need additional
academic support, enabling better and more targeted mentorship allocation. The model
utilizes a set of features including reads_books, book_genre_top1, and
screen_time_movies_series_hours_per_week.
